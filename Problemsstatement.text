1. Initially, I encountered difficulties while installing the "facerecognition" library.
2. I experienced a specific challenge involving false unknown face detection. The program mistakenly associated a detected face with a name that resembled an existing image, even though the correct data for that individual was unavailable.
3. Another issue arose when I needed to create folders and subfolders automatically during code execution.
4. I faced a problem where my program was increasing the attendance count after detecting each frame, leading to inaccurate results.
5. Retrieving data for encoding posed another challenge for me.
6. I also struggled with accurately recording the time of entry for attendance purposes. Additionally, determining whether a student was on time or late, and whether they were present or absent, proved to be complex.
7. Managing the assignment of IDs and additional details became quite messy.
8. Finally, the process of retrieving and displaying information posed a significant challenge.
